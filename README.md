<b>No Frameworks :zap: No Compilers :zap: No Libraries :zap: No Boilerplate</b>

Build 30 JavaScript app in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript; no frameworks, libraries, etc. Pacing is totally up to the individual. The idea behind these exercises is to utilize small amounts of what would regularly be `downtime` as moments in which we can build on our knowledge through some simple exercises.
